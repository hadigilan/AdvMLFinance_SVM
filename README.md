# AdvMLFinance_SVM
This repository provides the required files for tutorial 2 (SVM with R) for the course Advances of Machine Learning in Finance (ACCFIN5229) 
at Adam Smith Business School, at the University of Glasgow, 2022-23.


# R code
We use the svm function from e1071 package to run SVM classification in R. We have two examples to show the results of this function and interpretation:
1) iris dataset to illustrate how the SVM approach works with linear and nonlinear kernels
2) A real data to show the applicability of SVM in finance

# The PwerPoint file
In this file, we introduce some online recources on the e1071 package.
